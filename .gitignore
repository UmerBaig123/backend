# ## Dependencies ##
# The node_modules directory contains all of your project's installed
# dependencies. This folder can be very large and should always be
# generated by running `npm install` or `pnpm install` rather than
# being tracked in Git.
/node_modules

# ## Build Output ##
# If you are using a compiler like TypeScript, this is the folder where
# the compiled JavaScript output is placed. It should be generated during
# a build process, not tracked.
/dist
/build

# ## Log Files ##
# Log files are generated during runtime and can vary between environments.
# They should not be committed to version control.

# ## Environment Variables ##
# This is one of the most important files to ignore. The .env file contains
# sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and other secrets.
# Each developer should have their own local .env file.
# A .env.example file, however, SHOULD be committed to show what variables are needed.
